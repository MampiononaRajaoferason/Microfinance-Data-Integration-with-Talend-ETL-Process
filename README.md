# Overview

### Project Introduction

Welcome to our microfinance data integration project, where we embark on a journey to seamlessly blend technology and finance to empower decision-makers with valuable insights. In this endeavor, we've meticulously designed a data model that serves as the cornerstone of our ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) task. Our ETL program eagerly awaits the arrival of files in the landing zone, signaling the commencement of a well-orchestrated process. From the initial data validation to the intricate dance of transformations, culminating in the secure storage of tables and files in the archive folder, our project promises to be a testament to efficient data management and the power of informed decision-making.

### N.B. Project Data Warehousing

In this project, we've opted to use PostgreSQL as our data warehousing solution to demonstrate the ETL processes and data integration flows. While PostgreSQL is utilized here, it's essential to note that in real-world scenarios, the choice of data warehousing technology can vary significantly. Cloud-based data warehousing services like Google BigQuery or Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift may be more suitable for handling large-scale data and analytics needs. These cloud services offer scalable, high-performance data warehousing capabilities that can seamlessly integrate with ETL pipelines. This project serves as a foundation for showcasing ETL practices, with the understanding that data warehousing choices should align with the specific requirements and scale of the business or organization.

# Program Flow
- **Flow Schema:** (To Be Designed)

# Architecture and Design and Data Model
The microfinance data integration project is designed to efficiently consolidate and process financial data from three distinct sources: "encours.csv," "debs.csv," and "remb.csv." These sources include information about outstanding loans, customer details, disbursements, and loan repayments. The project's architectural design revolves around an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process with a specific focus on Slowly Changing Dimension 2 (SCD2) handling.

The ETL pipeline is structured into several stages, each serving a specific purpose in the data integration process.

### 1. Landing Zone

The project initiates in the "Landing Zone," where the raw data files, "encours.csv," "debs.csv," and "remb.csv," are expected to be deposited. The landing zone serves as the entry point for data into the ETL process.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize file ingestion and loading processes.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for file ingestion and log issues.
  - **Data Validation:** Perform initial data validation for data quality.

### 2. Staging Area

Upon arrival in the landing zone, the data files are processed in the "Staging Area." This stage involves several crucial operations:

- **Data Validation:** In this phase, the data undergoes validation checks to ensure its integrity and adherence to predefined data quality standards.
- **Data Cleaning:** Any data inconsistencies or errors are addressed and rectified during the cleaning phase.
- **Truncate Tables:** In this stage, tables are truncated, ensuring that data processing occurs for specific time periods (e.g., daily) or within defined intervals. This selective approach prevents reprocessing of the entire dataset.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize data validation and cleaning processes.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for data quality issues.
  - **Logging:** Log data validation and cleaning activities for auditing.

### 3. Data Modeling Staging

Following the staging area, the data transitions to the "Data Modeling Staging" phase. Here, data truncation occurs once again, ensuring that only the necessary data for the business's operational needs is carried forward. The data is structured and prepared to fit into the data model.- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Ensure efficient data transformation.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for data modeling activities.

### 4. Archive Folder

In the "Archive Stage," both the daily free files and the full tables derived from the data model are preserved. This dual storage approach provides historical context and retains the integrity of the data over time.

- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Consider data compression and storage optimization.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for archiving data.

### 5. Data Warehouse Staging

The core of the data warehousing process begins in the "Data Warehouse Staging" phase. Here, fact dimensions and dimension calculations are created and applied. Truncation, similar to previous stages, ensures that only the relevant data is incorporated, reducing redundancy and optimizing storage and processing.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize data transformation processes.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for data warehouse staging.

### 6. SCD2 for Customer Dimension

A pivotal component of the project is the implementation of Slowly Changing Dimension 2 (SCD2) handling, primarily focused on the customer dimension. SCD2 captures historical changes in dimension data over time, preserving a comprehensive history of customer records.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize SCD2 processing for customer dimension.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for SCD2 updates.

### 7. Final Data Warehouse Zone

The final outcome of the ETL process culminates in the "Final Data Warehouse Zone." Here, the results of dimension calculations and SCD2 handling are appended, enriching the data warehouse with a complete and historical set of financial information.

This architectural design showcases the project's dedication to data integrity, efficiency, and historical preservation of crucial financial information, making it a robust solution for microfinance data integration.- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Ensure efficient data warehouse querying.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for data warehousing processes.


## Additional Considerations

- **Data Quality Monitoring:** Set up data quality checks and monitoring.
- **Metadata Management:** Maintain metadata about ETL processes.
- **Data Security:** Implement access controls and data encryption.
- **Automated Testing:** Develop automated tests for ETL processes.
- **Incremental Data Processing:** Implement incremental data loading strategies.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up monitoring and logging solutions.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Develop a backup and recovery plan.
