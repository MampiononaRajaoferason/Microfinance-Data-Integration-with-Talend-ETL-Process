# Overview

### Project Introduction

Welcome to our microfinance data integration project, where we embark on a journey to seamlessly blend technology and finance to empower decision-makers with valuable insights. In this endeavor, we've meticulously designed a data model that serves as the cornerstone of our ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) task. Our ETL program eagerly awaits the arrival of files in the landing zone, signaling the commencement of a well-orchestrated process. From the initial data validation to the intricate dance of transformations, culminating in the secure storage of tables and files in the archive folder, our project promises to be a testament to efficient data management and the power of informed decision-making.

### N.B. Project Data Warehousing

In this project, we've opted to use PostgreSQL as our data warehousing solution to demonstrate the ETL processes and data integration flows. While PostgreSQL is utilized here, it's essential to note that in real-world scenarios, the choice of data warehousing technology can vary significantly. Cloud-based data warehousing services like Google BigQuery or Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift may be more suitable for handling large-scale data and analytics needs. These cloud services offer scalable, high-performance data warehousing capabilities that can seamlessly integrate with ETL pipelines. This project serves as a foundation for showcasing ETL practices, with the understanding that data warehousing choices should align with the specific requirements and scale of the business or organization.

# Program Flow
- **Flow Schema:** (To Be Designed)

# ETL Pipeline Architecture and Design

The ETL pipeline is structured into several stages, each serving a specific purpose in the data integration process.

### 1. Landing Zone

- **Purpose:** The landing zone is the initial repository for raw source data files.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize file ingestion and loading processes.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for file ingestion and log issues.
  - **Data Validation:** Perform initial data validation for data quality.

### 2. Staging Area

- **Purpose:** The staging area is where data is cleaned and validated.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize data validation and cleaning processes.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for data quality issues.
  - **Logging:** Log data validation and cleaning activities for auditing.

### 3. Data Modeling Staging

- **Purpose:** Data is loaded into a format suitable for the business data model.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Ensure efficient data transformation.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for data modeling activities.

### 4. Archive Folder

- **Purpose:** Archive both daily source files and full tables.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Consider data compression and storage optimization.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for archiving data.

### 5. Data Warehouse Staging

- **Purpose:** Build fact and dimension tables for the data warehouse.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize data transformation processes.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for data warehouse staging.

### 6. SCD2 for Customer Dimension

- **Purpose:** Implement Slowly Changing Dimension 2 (SCD2) for historical customer data.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Optimize SCD2 processing for customer dimension.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for SCD2 updates.

### 7. Final Data Warehouse Zone

- **Purpose:** Consolidate data for querying and reporting in the data warehouse.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Performance Optimization:** Ensure efficient data warehouse querying.
  - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for data warehousing processes.


## Additional Considerations

- **Data Quality Monitoring:** Set up data quality checks and monitoring.
- **Metadata Management:** Maintain metadata about ETL processes.
- **Data Security:** Implement access controls and data encryption.
- **Automated Testing:** Develop automated tests for ETL processes.
- **Incremental Data Processing:** Implement incremental data loading strategies.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Set up monitoring and logging solutions.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Develop a backup and recovery plan.
